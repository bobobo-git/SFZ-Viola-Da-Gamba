# Viola Da Gamba
fretted bowed instruments spun with gut  

came up from mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque periods.

i found some samles and made a sfz playable in sfz-players like sforzando from Plogue

the samples came from

and i was pleased to have fun making a sfz of the viol-samples
